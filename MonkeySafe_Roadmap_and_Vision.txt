MonkeySafe — Concept Roadmap & Technical Vision
===============================================

Overview:
---------
MonkeySafe is a branded concept for a minimalistic and secure vault dedicated to storing and displaying tokens built on the Layer 2 ecosystem of Pepe Unchained. The project is available for full acquisition, and its structure is built to enable a smooth transition from concept to live application.

Key Assets Provided:

Project Roadmap:
----------------

**Phase 1 — MVP (Token Tracker Vault)**
- Frontend-only DApp displaying token balances on L2 Pepe Unchained
- Wallet connection (via WalletConnect / MetaMask)
- Auto-fetch and list user-held tokens from the L2
- Built using Ethers.js or Viem with basic indexing or RPC fallback
- No backend required

**Phase 2 — Swap & Basic DeFi Integration**
- Token swapping via decentralized routers (Uniswap-like if available)
- Add network-specific routing if Pepe L2 supports it
- Optional: LP staking integrations if ecosystem supports it

**Phase 3 — Full Vault Suite**
- Token explorer
- On-chain transaction history per user
- Custom analytics / wallet profiling tools
- Optional: NFT support + collectibles tracking

Tech Stack Suggestion:

Positioning Statement:
----------------------
MonkeySafe is a project with a complete creative and product foundation. It is not just a concept, but a launch-ready identity with a defined roadmap, flexible enough to adapt, yet structured enough to build immediately.
